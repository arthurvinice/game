MONSTER GAME
----------------------

To play this game, just run the main file.

You are in an old house with 3 possible locations: kitchen, dinner room and party room.
Your action commands are: 'chat' and the 4 basic directions 'north', 'south', 'east' and 'west'.

If you die, the game ends. 
If you live, well.. feel free to explore o just quit.

Made by me. Arthur.
